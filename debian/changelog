  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * debian/control:
    + Bump Standards-Version: to 4.4.1. No changes needed.
    + Add Rules-Requires-Root: field and set it to no.
    + Don't build gnome-shell-extension-onboard anymore. It is broken with
      recent GNONME and there is no feedback from upstream about the future
      perspective of the shell extension.
      NOTE: for now, this is a temporary measure until the Debian maintainer
      has received feedback from Onboard upstream about this.
    + Enforce removal of gnome-shell-extension-onboard via B:/R: when upgrading
      onboard to this package version. (Closes: #891236).
    + Switch to debhelper-compat notation. Bump DH compat level to version 12.
  * debian/rules:
    + Switch from dh_install --fail-missing to dh_missing override.
    + Don't install gnome-shell extension files for Onboard anymore.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Drop COPYING file. Thanks, lintian.
